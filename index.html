     <p>I love listening to music from BTS like Serendipity, Euphoria, Butter, Dynamite and many more songs. In Dynamite and Butter the lyrics are English so i can understand it atleast. Butter was released for Summer vibes and it was awesome. BTS' latest work makes me as an army so happy! Serendipity just means that finding something fortunate/good when you are not looking for it. The song is just so precious and Jimin's voice is so sweet, honeyed, distinctive and full of vocal color. In Euphoria Jungkook's voice is  very unique soft, warm and bright.</p>
